## Key Features:

# User Authentication:

- The app incorporates user authentication, allowing users to log in securely with a fake authentication context.

- Authenticated users gain access to personalized features and data storage.

# Interactive Map:

- The application features an interactive map using the React Leaflet library, displaying markers for each city in the user's travel journal.
- Users can click on map markers to view city details and navigate to the city's Wikipedia page.

# Dynamic Routing:

- Utilizing React Router, the app supports dynamic routing, enabling users to access specific pages such as the home page, pricing, product information, and user login.

# Lazy Loading:

- The app implements lazy loading for improved performance, loading components only when needed, and incorporating a spinner for a seamless user experience.

# Data Persistence:

- The app employs local storage for data persistence, ensuring that user travel data is saved even after closing and reopening the application.

# Protected Routes:

- The application incorporates protected routes, ensuring that certain pages are accessible only to authenticated users. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page.

# Form Integration:

- Users can add new entries to their travel journal using a form that automatically populates location details based on the user's geolocation or map click.

# Context API Usage:

- The React Context API is employed to manage global state, facilitating seamless communication between components and enhancing the scalability of the application.

## Technologies Used:

- React (Hooks, Context API, Lazy Loading)
- React Router
- React Leaflet for interactive maps
- Custom hooks for geolocation and URL position parsing
- Local storage for data persistence
- CSS Modules for styling
